When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  If you don't have access to your local computer. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If you're not ready for the changes or do not want them. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks are only on Github, are tracked -- basically github clone to your own page. Clone is just a copy. Branch is completely different than the other two ... 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	Know what you've done since the last pull. Can see where other contributors had the head at a date/time. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	GitHub is amazing! Collaborating would be through email of code and other inefficient means. Basically everything would be harder other than the fact that collaborators would need to know GitHub/Git to collab. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	When you're not sure if the change will be good, will break master, others will like it.. Merge into master would be quick and easy, but separate branch makes it so others can see what you've done, allows master to be untouched in case you break it.
