How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Was able to see what changed, change means possible error

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Can look at changes you've made and see what direction you took in the past. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Sometimes you don't want to make a change, it could break a program 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Can go different directions with both files, can choose a path later on. Easier to work on programs piece by piece as well. Smaller chunks rather than huge edit. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Can see history of changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Can easly revert back to the older version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Anything and everything.
